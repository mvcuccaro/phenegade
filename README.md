php inetd bbs emulator
This was written as a demonstration of some modular architecture for php.
It uses a simple dispatcher to swap between modules/plugins feeding data between them with a dropfile - similar to old bbs doors.
It can be used as a nice telnet bbs if served up by inetd.
I named it phenegade in honor of my favorite bbs software - Renegade.
