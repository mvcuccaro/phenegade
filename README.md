# phenegade
php inetd bbs emulator :::
This was written as a demonstration of some modular architecture for php. 
It uses a simple dispatcher to swap between modules/plugins feeding data between them with a dropfile - similar to old bbs doors. 
It can be used as a nice telnet bbs if served up by inetd. 
I named it phenegade in honor of my favorite bbs software - Renegade. 

There may or may not be a demonstration running at 35.162.14.69 7575 available via a telnet client on linux or a good bbs client on windows/dos (windows telnet doesnt render the default ansi very good at all) - Just log in with username 'guest'
